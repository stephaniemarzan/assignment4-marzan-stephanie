            <summary>InBody Test</summary>
            <p>The InBody Test provides a comprehensive view of the components of the human body. These include water, protein, fat, muscle, etc. During an InBody appointment, the test is conducted and then I provide a detailed explanation of the results and provide basic recommendations. </p>

          <details open>
            <summary>Virtual Appointment</summary>
            <p>We set up a Zoom call to discuss your goals and how we can change your lifestyle to achieve those goals. Patients with virual appointments have access to an app called Healthie where they can log their goals, food, hunger cues, text with me, among other features.</p>
          </details>

          <details open>
            <summary>In-person Appointment</summary>
            <p>In-person appointments include an InBody test. The test is conducted at the beginning of the appointment and based on the results we set a game plan to work on areas of improvement. This usually consists of an educational session on how to eat based on your goals and current health as well as an informational packet to take home with recommendations.</p>
